linked lists:
1. It is a linear data structure
2. In many places is arrays are replaced by linked lists.

How does it works?
1. It is  a collection of nodes
2. A node a object which contains two components. one is for data and other is for address.
3. Here, every node has a address and it is stored in other node's address pointer. 
   This makes nodes to link one another.
4. In linked lists nodes are not in continous memory location like arrays.
